# refclock-tools
Simple and clean interfacing of GPS to NTP servers

* **nmea_agent** - a NMEA refclock
* **nmea_plotter** - a program that produces skyview png files for your webserver or enjoyment.
* **pps_agent** - a PPS refclock that gets coarse time from another shm, with indefinite autonomy.
* **pps_edgetest_x86** - a very ugly program that measures PPS edge timing through polling. It is dangerous, but produces a measurement with hard bounds.
* **pps_edgetest_rpi** - A similarly ugly version for Raspberry Pi/Pi+/2.
